## Final Project Options:

Choose one of the options below - or suggest a new one:

### 1: Fixing bugs in one of the PlaygroundProjectStarter example games.

Play through at least two of the games in the Examples folder and make a list **in your notes** of the _bugs_ that you find (bugs are places where the game does not behave the way a reasonable person would expect it to). Then, pick a game to work on, and using your notes write up descriptions of the bugs - what is wrong; how to reproduce the problem; what the behavior should be - in a new file called `<game name>-Bugs.md` in the top level of your PlaygroundProjectStarter repository. You can do this locally or you can create and edit the file on GitHub.

### 2: Modifying one of the games in the PlaygroundProjectStarter examples.

Play through at least two of the games in the Examples folder and make a list **in your notes** of improvements that would make it a better game in your view. Then, pick a game to work on, and using your notes write up descriptions of your proposed changes - in a new file called `<game name>-Next-Release.md` in the top level of your PlaygroundProjectStarter repository. You can do this locally or you can create and edit the file on GitHub.

### 3: Creating a new game using the PlaygroundProjectStarter toolkit.

**In your notes** sketch out ideas for a new game based on the PlaygroundProjectStarter toolkit. Then create a new folder, _MyGames_, in the Assets folder of your PlaygroundProjectStarter fork and in there create a folder for this game idea. The result will be similar to the layout of the `Examples` folder that comes with the PlaygroundProjectStarter toolkit.

In the folder you just created create a file, `<game-name>-Milestones.md` and write up a description of your game idea and make a checklist of milestones for your project.

### 4: Creating a new game in Unity from scratch.

**In your notes** sketch out your game idea. Then create a new repository on GitHub to hold your game, add a README and a Unity .gitignore. Clone the repository to your computer and create a new Unity project in that folder. Save your first scene (the scene can be empty, Git ignores empty folders so creating and saving the first scene will ensure that the Assets folder gets tracked). Finally add the the Assets and ProjectSettings folders to Git, commit your changes, and push them to GitHub.

At the top level of your repository create a file, `<game-name>-Milestones.md` and write up a description of your game idea and make a checklist of milestones for your project.

## Submit:

Ensure that your changes have been pushed to GitHub and submit a link to your fork of the PlaygroundProjectStarter repository (or the repository that your created for an original game).
